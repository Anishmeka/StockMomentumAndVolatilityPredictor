#Running Application:
* This application contains two running configurations: **train-model** and **stock-data-visualizer**
* Change the working directory by editing these configurations. Change the file path of the working directory to end with
~my-projects/[directory-name]. This will allow you to use relative file paths in place of absolute file paths.
* You will now be able to run and debug these configurations. Running the **train-model** configuration will create 
the training data set, train the model, and test the model. Running the **stock-data-visualizer** will render a technical
analysis chart, candlestick charts, predictions, and price summaries in an external window.
  
#**Analyzing Charts:**
* Carefully scrutinizing the technical analysis and candlestick charts for bullish or bearish patterns or high, medium,
or low volatilities will improve your skills as a day-trader and empower you to make quick, confident decisions.
* A green trend line conveys a positive difference between the closing price and opening price, whereas a red line conveys
a negative difference between the closing price and opening price. Check the image below to see an example of a technical
analysis chart and identify it when running the **stock-data-visualizer**:

* A green candlestick body conveys a tendency towards high volatility during that respective trading day, whereas a red 
candlestick body conveys a tendency towards low volatility during that respective trading day. In rare events, a doji candle,
  one with a single horizontal line in place of a red or green body conveys a tendency towards medium volatility. Check 
  the image below to see an example of a candlestick chart and identify it when running the **stock data visualizer**:
